# policy explainers

plain-English deep dives on each policy in this repo — what it is, how it works, the math, and how it differs from the others. read in this order; each builds on the last.

> **want to learn by coding?** [`exercises/`](exercises/) has from-scratch PyTorch exercises

| # | doc | model | one-liner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [act.md](act.md) | **ACT** | transformer directly predicts a 100-step action chunk; CVAE captures demo variability |
| 2 | [diffusion_policy.md](diffusion_policy.md) | **Diffusion Policy** | denoise a corrupted action chunk back to clean (DDPM + 1-D U-Net) |
| 3 | [dit_flow.md](dit_flow.md) | **DiT + Flow Matching** | same denoising idea, but transformer denoiser + straight-line flow matching + language |
| 4 | [pi0.md](pi0.md) | **π0** | flow matching, but the encoder is a full 2B vision-language model (PaliGemma) |
| 5 | [pi05.md](pi05.md) | **π0.5** | π0 tuned for open-world generalization (longer language, quantile norm, co-training) |
| 6 | [pi0_fast.md](pi0_fast.md) | **π0-FAST** | π0's backbone, but actions become discrete tokens generated like text (no ODE) |

## the big picture — two families

                                  π0 / π0.5 ─────────┤

```

**the shared paradigm** (everything except ACT): condition on the present (images + joints + maybe language), corrupt the future action chunk with noise, train the network to predict the correction. they differ in *how* they corrupt (DDPM vs flow matching vs tokenization), *what* denoiser they use (U-Net vs DiT vs full VLM), and *whether* they use language.

**ACT** sits apart: no denoising, just direct prediction with a CVAE latent for handling demo variability.

## how to pick one

| your situation | use |
|---|---|
| simplest baseline, CPU ok, single task | **ACT** |
| multimodal task (many valid solutions), have a GPU | **Diffusion Policy** |
| want language conditioning + modern flow recipe | **DiT + Flow Matching** |
| want a pretrained foundation model, multi-task, generalization | **π0 / π0.5** |
| same as π0 but inference speed is critical | **π0-FAST** |

> reality check for this repo: we have very few demonstrations. these are pipeline
> integrations, not trained-to-convergence policies. ACT and Diffusion Policy are the
> realistic ones to actually train here; the π0 family needs a GPU + PaliGemma weights
> and shines with large/diverse data.
